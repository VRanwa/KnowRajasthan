                <h2>Adhai-Din Ka Jhonpra</h2>
                <p>Beyond the Dargah of Khwaja Mu'in al-Din Chishti, on the town outskirts, are the extraordinary ruins of the Adhai-din-ka-Jhonpra mosque and it is one of the famous places to visit in Ajmer.

                    According to legend, construction in 1153 took only two-and-a-half days. Others say it was named after a festival lasting two-and-a-half days. It was originally built as a Sanskrit college, but in 1198 Mohammed of Ghori seized Ajmer and converted the building into a mosque by adding a seven-arched wall covered with Islamic calligraphy in front of the pillared hall.

                <h2>Ana Sagar Lake</h2>
                <p>The well-known man-made lake Ana Sagar was constructed by Maharaja Anaji between 1135 to 1150 AD, the ancestor of Maharaja Prithviraj Chauhan. Later the Mughal rulers made some further modifications to enhance the lake and it is one of the best places to visit in Ajmer

                    Near the lake is the Daulat Bagh, a garden set out by Emperor Jahangir. Emperor Shah Jahan later added five pavilions, called as the Baradari, among the garden and the lake.
                    The lake is an interesting family outing spot. An island lies in the middle of the lake.</p>
